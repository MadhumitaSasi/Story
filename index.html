        Poseidon, one of the Twelve Olympians in ancient Greek religion and mythology, holds dominion over the sea, storms, earthquakes, and horses. Revered as the protector of seafarers and the guardian of numerous Hellenic cities and colonies, Poseidon wields a trident, symbolizing his power over the ocean’s depths. His presence resonates both on Mount Olympus and across the vast expanse of the sea. Born to the titans Cronus and Rhea, Poseidon shares divine lineage with Zeus and his other siblings. His consort is Amphitrite, and their offspring include Triton, Rhodos, and Theseus, among others. The name Poseidon evokes the mighty force of the sea, and he remains an enduring figure in ancient Greek mythology. In Roman mythology, Poseidon finds his counterpart in Neptune, further emphasizing his connection to the watery realms. Whether conjuring tempests or guiding sailors, Poseidon’s influence extends far beyond the waves, leaving an indelible mark on the ancient cultural tapestry of Greece.</p>

    <p>Poseidon, the god of the sea, was a brother of Zeus, the sky god and chief deity of ancient Greece, and of Hades, god of the underworld. Together with Hades, they split dominion over the realms of the universe between themselves after the defeat of the Titans. When the three brothers deposed their father, the kingdom of the sea fell by lot to Poseidon. Zeus received the sky, Poseidon got the ocean, and Hades got the Underworld.</p>
