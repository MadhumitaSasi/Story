    <h4>BEFORE THE CURSE</h4>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>Originally, Medusa was a ravishing maiden, with a beauty that captivated all who saw her. Among her most admired features were her magnificent hair and striking eyes. She served as a priestess in the temple of Athena, a role that required a vow of celibacy. Medusa's life took a dramatic turn due to her beauty, which attracted the sea god Poseidon. In a sacrilegious act, Poseidon ravished Medusa within the confines of Athena's temple. This desecration enraged Athena. However, instead of directing her wrath at Poseidon, Athena cursed Medusa, transforming her into a Gorgon. Medusa's hair turned into venomous snakes, and her once-admired gaze became a curse, turning anyone who looked directly at her to stone. This transformation marked Medusa's descent from celebrated beauty to monstrous outcast.

    <h4>LIFE AS A MONSTER</h4>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>As a Gorgon, Medusa was exiled and forced to live far from civilization, often identified as living on the island of Sarpedon, a place where she could harm no one who did not seek her out. Despite her monstrous appearance and deadly abilities, Medusa was not inherently evil. The curse was a form of divine punishment, not a choice. Her isolation and the fear she instilled were more tragic than malevolent, with her gaze offering instant death to any onlooker. The loneliness of Medusa's existence was profound, surrounded by stone figures that used to be unwitting victims who either sought her out for glory or stumbled upon her accidentally.Using the reflective shield to guide him, Perseus approached Medusa while she slept, avoiding the deadly gaze reflected in his polished shield. He decapitated her with the harpe, and from her neck sprang Pegasus, the winged horse, and Chrysaor, a giant wielding a golden sword, both fathered by Poseidon. Perseus used Medusa's head as a powerful weapon on several occasions before finally presenting it to Athena, who affixed it to her shield, the Aegis, as both a protective measure and a symbol of her own power.

    <h4>THE DEATH OF MEDUSA</h4>

    <br>
    <p>Medusa's fate was sealed when Perseus, the son of Zeus and DanaÃ«, was tasked with retrieving her head. This quest was instigated by King Polydectes of Seriphus, who desired Perseus's mother and wanted Perseus out of the way. Guided by the gods who opposed Medusa, Perseus received several divine tools: winged sandals from Hermes for flight, a helm of invisibility from Hades to avoid detection, a reflective shield from Athena to view Medusa without direct sight, and a harpe, a sharp, sickle-like weapon.

    <br>
    <p>The story of Medusa encompasses themes of beauty, violation, retribution, and heroism. Over centuries, interpretations of Medusa's story have evolved, often reflecting societal attitudes towards gender, power, and victimization. In modern contexts, Medusa has emerged as a symbol of solidarity and resistance against injustice, her story resonating with those who see her not as a monster, but as a victim of divine politics and human cruelty.
